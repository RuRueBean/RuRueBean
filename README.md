- 👋 Hi, I’m @RuRueBean
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, research, movies, history (world specifically), and continuing to grow and gain as much knowledge in data analyitics as I can.  I am new to the field so any chance I can get to gain more experience, I am more than happy to take part.  
- 🌱I am currently a certified Data Scientist.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate any projects that will help me build a good portfolio and to expand my knowledge of data analyitics and data science
- 📫 How to reach me ...You can reach me at ruemarie41@gmail.com
